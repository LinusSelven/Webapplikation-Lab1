Nevertheless, pulling off a nice backhander or deking past an opposing defender feels great, and is well worth the effort put into learning those moves.\n\nFor the price of free, the game is definitely worth checking out. A high skill floor plus a high skill ceiling makes for an intense and entertaining multiplayer experience."

A player base will never expand if new players can't learn how to play without being forced to go against players with loads of practice. I'd recommend the game just for more newer players to play with,but I don't see myself returning often,if ever."
